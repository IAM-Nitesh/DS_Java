Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type

1.Array sizes doesn't grow i.e.

2.we cannot add new values or delete values in an array.
  However, we can update values in the array

3.all arrays are dynamically allocated.

4.An array can contain primitives (int, char, etc.) and
object (or non-primitive) references of a class depending
on the definition of the array.
In the case of primitive data types, the actual values
might be stored in contiguous memory locations
(JVM does not guarantee this behavior).
In the case of class objects, the actual objects are
stored in a heap segment.

5. we canâ€™t specify the size of array as long but we can specify it as int or short.

6. An Object is direct superclass of an array in Java.

7. Every array type implements the interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable.

8. The size of the array cannot be altered(once initialized).
   However, an array reference can be made to point to another array.

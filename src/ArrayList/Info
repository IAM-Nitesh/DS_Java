1.The ArrayList class is a part of Collection framework, extends AbstractList class
and implements the List interface.
Dynamic Array of objects which can be declared without
defining the size at the time of declaration.

How ArrayList Works?
When an ArrayList is created, its default capacity or size is 10 if not provided by the user.
The size of the ArrayList grows based on load factor and current capacity.

Threshold = (Load Factor) * (Current Capacity)
For example, if the user creates an ArrayList of size 10,
Threshold = Load Factor * Current Capacity
          = 0.75 * 10
          â‰… 7

This means after adding the 7th element to the list, the size will increase as it has reached the threshold value.
Internally, a new ArrayList with a new capacity is created and the elements present in the old ArrayList are copied
in the new ArrayList.

a.The backing data structure of ArrayList is an array.
b.When the array becomes full and we want to add new elements, a new ArrayList with a new capacity is created.
c.The elements present in the old ArrayList are copied in the new ArrayList, while deleting the old ArrayList.

new_capacity = old_capacity + (old_capacity >> 1)
The new capacity will be 10 + (10 >> 1) => 10 + 5 => 15. Hence, the size is increased from 10 to 15.

2.Can not hold primitive data types.
Hence, can be created only for objects like wrapper classes - Integer, String etc

3. Removal from the end is quicker than from the start as
there would be swapping of the elements involved.
Hence, Always prefer removal from end for better performance.

4. It implements List, RandomAccess, Cloneable and Serializable interfaces

5. They are slower than built-in arrays, their resizable nature is advantageous
 in programs requiring frequent array manipulations

6. Not Synchronized: ArrayList in Java is not synchronized,
we can use the Vector class for the synchronized version.
It means ArrayList operations are not thread-safe and multiple threads should not operate on the same ArrayList object at the same time.
